                        <p>We have most parts needed to repair most bikes. However, we cannot guarantee we have all parts, especially if they are uncommon, higher end, or newer parts.
                            <br><br>If you know you need a specific part, please let us know in advance or indicate it when you book your appointment.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we can! We recommend booking both a 30 and 15 minute appointment to ensure we have enough time to get it fully built and safety checked. It may require more time if the bike has many accessories.</p>

                        <p>We cannot store bikes overnight under any circumstances.
                        <br><br>If you have an appointment at the downtown shop you can drop your bike off at your scheduled time and pick it up before we close that day, so long as we can contact you if we have questions about repairs.

                        <p>Walk-ins are allowed if there’s enough space, at the discretion of our volunteers. You may need to wait or come back another day if we are busy and you don’t have an appointment.</p>

                        <p>Volunteers provide limited hands-off guidance for DIY repairs, but will not do the work for you. They can show you where to find tools and parts, give cursory help assessing your bike, and point you towards useful resources for necessary repairs.</p>

                        <p>We have a wide range of general and bike specific tools. Each workbench has the most commonly used tools. You will need to ask to use more specialized tools (alignment, taps, etc.).
                            <br><br>Always ask for help if you’re unsure how to use tools correctly. We are not responsible for damage caused by their misuse.</p>

                        <p>DIY appointments are currently 1 hour, though you may be able to stay longer if space and time allow. You are responsible for finishing your work in the time available and cleaning up before you go.</p>

                        <p>We have a wide selection of used parts and a limited selection of essential new parts. We can usually provide parts to make most bikes safe and functional, but they may not match, be in nice visual shape, etc.</p>
